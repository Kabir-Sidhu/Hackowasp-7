## üîó Blockchain Integration

### Wallet Connection

GPULend supports three wallet providers:

1. **Internet Identity**: ICP's native identity service
2. **NFID (New Finance ID)**: A cross-chain identity solution
3. **Plug Wallet**: A browser extension wallet for ICP

To connect:
- Click the "Connect Wallet" button in the header
- Select your preferred wallet provider
- Follow the authentication prompts

### Token Approvals and Transfers

The platform uses ICRC2 token standard for payments and security deposits:

1. **Token Approval**: Allow the platform to transfer tokens on your behalf
2. **Token Transfer**: Transfer tokens between users for rental payments
3. **Balance Checking**: View your current balance and transaction history

## üìã Usage Guide

### For GPU Owners

1. Connect your wallet
2. Navigate to "List GPU"
3. Fill in your GPU details, pricing, and availability
4. Set your payout wallet address
5. Submit and wait for rental requests

### For AI Developers

1. Connect your wallet
2. Browse available GPUs
3. Select a GPU and upload your model
4. Pay the rental fee using ICRC2 tokens
5. Monitor your task's progress

## üîí Security Considerations

- Wallet connection is optional but recommended for full functionality
- The platform stores minimal user information
- Multiple wallet provider support enhances security
- Token approvals are user-controlled and can be revoked

## üß™ Development Environment

- **Local Development**: Uses localhost endpoints
- **Production**: Uses mainnet ICP endpoints
- **Configuration**: Environment-specific settings managed through env variables
